Intro

Several methods are improving each year their ability to predict 3D structures starting from protein sequences.
However, it is still a very hard task for these procedures to identify the optimal fold. 
It is subsequently very important to pair such methods with a quality assessment (QA) step, in order to verify 
modeled structures reliability. 
In this CASP edition we submitted QA scores derived from two different Deep Learning-based methods, 
ProQ4[1] and GraphQA[2]. 

ProQ4 Method

ProQ4 is a Deep Learning predictor which uses evolutionary information and a coarse representation of the protein models 
to be evaluated, in order to predict a metric of local quality, the Local Distance Difference Test. 
ProQ4's neural network adopt a particular architecture which allows to compare pairs of protein models. 
The predictor ability to discriminate which one of the models in the pair is better, is proven to confer 
a significant boost in the absolute local QAs.
