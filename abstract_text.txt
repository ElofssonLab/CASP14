Title
Advanced Deep-Learning applications on protein models quality assessment.

Intro

Several methods are improving each year their ability to predict 3D structures starting from protein sequences.
However, it is still a very hard task for these procedures to identify the optimal fold. 
It is subsequently very important to follow up such methods with a quality assessment (QA) step, in order to verify 
modeled structures reliability. 
In this CASP edition we submitted QA scores derived from two different Deep Learning-based predictors, 
ProQ4[1] and GraphQA[2]. 

ProQ4 Method

ProQ4 is a Deep Learning predictor which uses as input evolutionary information as well as coarse representation 
of the protein models to be evaluated. The goal of this method is to predict the Local Distance Difference Test (LDDT) 
in order to obtain a metric of local quality. 
ProQ4's neural network adopt a complex architecture which allows to compare pairs of protein models. 
The predictor ability to discriminate which one of the models in the pair is better, is proven to confer 
a significant boost in the absolute local QAs.
